# Deno Embed

This repo distributes pre-built v8 snapshots from the [main Deno cli package](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/cli/build.rs).

The build script is largely unaltered. The dependencies are pinned to a specific release of Deno. You can find the snapshots under the [releases section](https://github.com/alshdavid/deno_embed/releases)

TODO

Create a crate that makes it easy to consume Deno functionality from a Rust project, including Deno standard library, Node.js resolutions and the Node.js standard library.
